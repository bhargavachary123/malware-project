        <h2>Malware</h2><br>
        <p style="font-size: large;"">Malware is one of the most serious security threats on the Internet today. Malware refers to any 
            kind of malicious codes that affect the integrity, confidentiality and the functionality of the digital 
            system. Malware is separated into various classes by their functionalities i.e., Viruses, Worms, 
            Trojans, Spyware and Backdoors. These classes further divide into families based of the type of 
            variants.</p>
        <p style=" font-size: large;">
            In the following years, convolutional
            neural networks(CNN), which are one of the important
            components of deep learning in the field of computer vision, the use of CNN
            networks has come to the fore in the analysis of CG images. CNN has shown superior performance
            compared to traditional learning algorithms, especially in tasks such as image classification. We have used
            CNN based architecture to classify the malware images into various sub-classes.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Dataset</h2><br>
        <p style="font-size: large;"> We used Malevis dataset which consists of 8750 training and 3644 test malware
            images which are classified into 25 malware classes.
            <a href="https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/malevis/" target="_blank">link</a> to the dataset.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Results</h2><br>

        <p style="font-size: large;"><b>Resnet50</b><br>
            Using Resnet50 model we were able to achieve an acuuracy of <b>94.5%</b> on Malevis dataset. We implemented
            resnet50 using transfer learning from keras and tensorflow library. Transfer Learnign allows us to use
            weights learnt convolutional neural networks like Resnet, Inception or VGG and fine tune it for your image
            data. <br> Below is the truth table achieved using CNN where zero to
            24 represents the 25 different malware classes.<br>
            <br><h4>Confusion Matrix:</h4>

        <p style="font-size: large;"><b>CNN</b><br>
            Using normal CNN architecture we were able to achieve an acuuracy of <b>93.20%</b> on Malevis dataset. The
            CNN architecture consists
            of two convolution layers and three dense layers. Below is the truth table achieved using CNN where zero to
            24 represents the 25 different malware classes.<br>
